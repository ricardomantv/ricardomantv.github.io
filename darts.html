        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong><em>Collaborators:</em></strong> Breeana Ebert</p>
        <p><strong><em>Role:</em></strong> Programmer</p>
        <p>Lawn Darts VR is a game for the Oculus Rift made for the Research Topics in Game Development class at CMU. The only goal of the
           project was to make a game based on the backyard game, Lawn Darts. In this game, players are attacked by wave after wave of angry
           parents trying to ban Lawn Darts and must defend themselves using these very same darts.
        </p>
        <h2>Intention</h2>
        <p>Looking up the history of Lawn Darts online, we found that they were banned in the United States due to a campaign started by
           a single parent that was upset about the safety of the game. We wanted the gameplay to be somewhat similar to Call of Duty:
           Zombies, where players hold down their ground as wave after wave of zombies attack them, except in our game the context is of
           angry protesting parents instead.
        </p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>The game was made using the Unity game engine and its built-in Oculus packages. The game can be played using an Oculus Rift with
           an Xbox gamepad controller. In game, the player is able to move around, jump, and throw lawn darts. The art assets were all gathered
           from the Unity store and a number of other free 3d model websites online. Unfortunately due to time constraints we were never able
           to make custom art for the game, aside from the protest sign asset that I modeled in Autodesk Maya for parents to hold.

        </div>
        <p>The setting takes place in a relatively simple backyard setting, that features a house, a playground, and a forest area. Enemies
           spawn randomly from one of those three areas and move towards the player. The level and spawn points are set up in a way where
           enemies will have to travel along a streamlined path to reach the player, so players will have a chance to kill the enemies before
           they reach a point where they coud harm the player.

        <p>The game lasts as long as the player is able to keep the onslaught of angry parents at bay. Players are able to keep track of their
           health based on how red their vision is; at full health the vision will be normal, but will start to gain a red tint as they start
           to get hit. Once a player loses all of their health, they are presented with the number of kills they got in their playthrough.
