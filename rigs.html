        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>These character rigs were the two projects made throughout my Character Rigging for Production class.
        </p>
        <h2>Intent</h2>
        <p>The first character is a simple humanoid character that was used to teach the fundamentals of character rigging, like
           creating FK/IK controls for the arms and legs, movement controls for the head and torso, setting up custom pose controls,
           and space switching and dynamic parenting. The second character, Ray, is a more traditional 3D model that would have to
           be rigged. This rig features all of the controls from the previous character, but also includes techniques like skin weight
           painting, corrective blendshapes, a facial rig control scheme, and extra general character options like scaling.
        </p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>The arms and legs of the characters have both FK (Forward Kinematic) controls that allow animators to influence parts of the
           arm/leg separately and IK (Inverse Kinematic) controls that control the entire arm/leg with one control. The characters also
           have a meta control located near each arm/leg that allows the user to switch between using their respective FK/IK control.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>The Ray character's mesh is bound to the joint skeleton system through the Heat Map skinning algorithm. While this does a
          good job of binding the mesh and joints together, it is not perfect and some joint-skin influences still need to be edited,
          which is done through skin weight painting. I used this technique to paint how much influence specific joints have over
          vertices of the 3D model when moved, with black representing no influence and white representing a maximum influence. For
          example, the shoulder joint of a model will have complete influence over the skin directly next to the joint, but have a slowly
          decreasing amount of influence over vertices that are farther away from the shoulder. This technique is applied to almost
          every single joint in the skeleton so that the rig can be animated with the most realistic-looking movement possible.
        </p>

          <p class="image-caption">Influences for the shoulder joint on the mesh.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Ray also uses a Delta Mush deformer and Corrective Blendshapes to further tweak his mesh for poses that painting skin weights
           alone cannot fix. The Delta Mush deformer automatically reshapes the mesh when it is moved by a joint to make it more like
           its default rest state (the T-pose from the first pictures). The intensity of this deformer is painted onto the mesh in a way
           similar to the skin weights in the last picture.
        </p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Corrective Blendshapes will reshape parts of a mesh when joints reach certain translation or rotation values to look more like
           a separate reference mesh. For example, to have Ray's mouth not look rectangular when opened, I created a copy of his head and
           sculpted the lips inward to make it more circular. Since these changes would look awkward when Ray's mouth was closed, the mouth
           control is set to begin mimicking the edited reference when the mouth is opened by a certain amount.

        </div>
        <p>Ray also has a facial rig to allow the animator to control Ray's mouth, cheeks, and eyebrows to create expressions. There are
           controls on both corners of the mouth that control the shape of the mouth. Translating the controls up and down will shape the
           mouth into a smile or frown, while translating them in and out will thin or widen the mouth. Controls on the cheeks allow the
           user to puff Ray's cheeks out or suck them in by pulling them away or towards Ray's face.

        <p>Ray also features both eyelid controls to open/close Ray's eyes. The eyelids close in both directions, and also have an
           option to open the eyes wider. Eyebrow controls that animators can use to move either parts of Ray's eyebrows, or his
           eyebrows as a whole.

        <h2>Product</h2>
        <p>The first character is complete, and the Autodesk Maya file can be found <a href="files/char_FINAL.ma">here</a>.</p>
        <p>The Ray character is still in progress, but the latest version of the rig can be downloaded <a href="files/ray_FINAL.ma">here</a>.</p>
        <p><em>Note: These files both require Autodesk Maya to open.</em></p>
