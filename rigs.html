        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>These character rigs were the two projects made throughout my Character Rigging for Production class.
        </p>
        <h2>Intent</h2>
        <p>The first character is a simple humanoid character that was used to teach the fundamentals of character rigging, like
           creating FK/IK controls for the arms and legs, movement controls for the head and torso, setting up custom pose controls,
           and space switching and dynamic parenting. The second character, Ray, is a more traditional 3D model that would have to
           be rigged. This rig features all of the controls from the previous character, but also includes techniques like skin weight
           painting, corrective blendshapes, a facial rig control scheme, and extra general character options like scaling.
        </p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>The arms and legs of the characters have both FK (Forward Kinematic) controls that allow animators to influence parts of the
           arm/leg separately and IK (Inverse Kinematic) controls that control the entire arm/leg with one control. The characters also
           have a meta control located near each arm/leg that allows the user to switch between using thier respective FK/IK control.
         </p>
         <p>The Ray character's mesh is bound to the joint skeleton system through the Heat Map skinning algorithm. While this does a
            good job of binding the mesh and joints together, it is not perfect and some joint-skin influences still need to be edited,
            which is done through skin weight painting. I used this technique to paint how much influence specific joints have over
            vertices of the 3D model when moved, with black representing no influence and white representing a maximum influence. For
            example, the shoulder joint of a model will have complete influence over the skin directly next to the joint, but have a slowly
            decreasing amount of influence over vertices that are farther away from the shoulder. This technique is applied to almost
            every single joint in the skeleton so that the rig can be animated with the most realistic-looking movement possible.
          </p>
          <p>Ray also uses a Delta Mush deformer and Corrective Blendshapes to further tweak his mesh for poses that painting skin weights
             alone cannot fix. 
          </p>
        <h2>Product</h2>
        <p>The first character is complete, and the Autodesk Maya file can be found <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
        <p>The Ray character is still in progress, but the latest version of the rig can be downloaded <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
        <p><em>Note: These files both require Autodesk Maya to open.</em></p>
