        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong><em>Role:</em></strong> Solo Programmer/Artist</p>
        <p><strong><em>Tools Used:</em></strong> Unity3D, Autodesk Maya, Blender, Adobe Photoshop</p>
        <p><strong><em>Awards:</em></strong> 3rd Place, Fraternity Division, Carnegie Mellon Spring Carnival 2018</p>
        <p>Twilight Crisis is a 2-player arcade shooter-style game featured in Sigma Phi Epsilon's booth for CMU's Spring Carnival 2018.
           SigEp's booth theme was based on <em>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</em>, and the game was inspired by the <em>Time Crisis</em> series but
           themed with locations and enemies from the <em>Twilight Princess</em> game.
        </p>
        <p><em>Disclaimer:</em> This game is in no way an official <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, nor will it be sold or distributed to the public for legal reasons. <body>
           including it in Sigma Phi Epsilon's booth, I am not claiming it to be a Sigma Phi Epsilon or Carnegie Mellon University product. All designs for character models
           and effects from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</em> belong to Nintendo Co., Ltd.
        </p>

        <h2>Intent</h2>
        <p>Considering the volume of people that tend to go through the booths during Carnival in general, I wanted to create a game this year that would not only allow more
           people to experience the game at once, but also allow them to share the experience together. This is what led me to decide to make a multiplayer game, and I also
           wanted to keep the arcade-y spirit that booth games generally tend to have as well. A combination of <em>Time Crisis</em> and <em>Link's Crossbow Training</em> is
           what led me to land on this style of idea.
        </p>
        <p>My favorite aspect of <em>Twilight Princess</em> is the dynamic between Hyrule and the Twilight Realm, so I wanted to make a game that would take advantage of both
           worlds. Like the actual game, you begin in the forest area, the Faron Woods. Once the level is cleared, the players are transported through a Twilight Portal into the
           Twilight Realm. Eventually the players will progress to fight the Twilight Usurper King, Zant, after which in classic <em>Legend of Zelda</em> fashion, players have
           the final battle against The Great King of Evil himself, Ganondorf.
        </p>

        <h2>Product</h2>
        <p>Twilight Crisis was featured in Sigma Phi Epsilon's booth for the entirety of Spring Carnival 2018, which ran from Thursday, April 19th through Sunday, April 22nd.
           The game was featured in the Portrait Hall room on the second floor of the booth.
