        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong><em>Role:</em></strong> Solo Programmer/Artist</p>
        <p><strong><em>Tools Used:</em></strong> Unity3D, Autodesk Maya, Blender, Adobe Photoshop</p>
        <p><strong><em>Awards:</em></strong> 3rd Place, Fraternity Division, Carnegie Mellon Spring Carnival 2018</p>
        <p>Twilight Crisis is a 2-player arcade shooter-style game featured in Sigma Phi Epsilon's booth for CMU's Spring Carnival 2018.
           SigEp's booth theme was based on <em>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</em>, and the game was inspired by the <em>Time Crisis</em> series but
           themed with locations and enemies from the <em>Twilight Princess</em> game.
        </p>
        <p><em>Disclaimer:</em> This game is in no way an official <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, nor will it be sold or distributed to the public for legal reasons. <body>
           including it in Sigma Phi Epsilon's booth, I am not claiming it to be a Sigma Phi Epsilon or Carnegie Mellon University product. All designs for character models
           and effects from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</em> belong to Nintendo Co., Ltd.
        </p>

        <h2>Intent</h2>
        <p>Considering the volume of people that tend to go through the booths during Carnival in general, I wanted to create a game this year that would not only allow more
           people to experience the game at once, but also allow them to share the experience together. This is what led me to decide to make a multiplayer game, and I also
           wanted to keep the arcade-y spirit that booth games generally tend to have as well. A combination of <em>Time Crisis</em> and <em>Link's Crossbow Training</em> is
           what led me to land on this style of idea.
        </p>
        <p>My favorite aspect of <em>Twilight Princess</em> is the dynamic between Hyrule and the Twilight Realm, so I wanted to make a game that would take advantage of both
           worlds. Like the actual game, you begin in the forest area, the Faron Woods. Once the level is cleared, the players are transported through a Twilight Portal into the
           Twilight Realm. Eventually the players will progress to fight the Twilight Usurper King, Zant, after which in classic <em>Legend of Zelda</em> fashion, players have
           the final battle against The Great King of Evil himself, Ganondorf.
        </p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>The game follows the same general pattern of Time Crisis where players travel through the level and stop at specific areas where enemies begin to appear. The players
           must clear the area of all enemies before they are brought to the next area. To achieve this level scrolling effect, I set waypoints throughout the level that would
           denote the position and rotation of the camera for areas where enemies would appear, and wrote a rails script that calculated a bezier curve between the points for
           the camera to travel along.
        </p>

          <p class="image-caption">A path of waypoints (white spheres) to form the camera's bezier curve</p>
        </div>

        <p>All of the enemies featured in the game are the direct models from <em>Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</em>. While most of the character models came pre-textured, the
        the models did not come rigged or animated. For the non-humanoid characters, I manually rigged and animated the characters myself. Due to time constraints, I only used
        linear skin binding with minor skin weight painting.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>For the humanoid meshes, I used Adobe Mixamo process for automatic rigging and animating. Specifically for Ganondorf, I downloaded an FBX of his Mixamo-generated rig, as well
        as the skeleton data for several different animations to be featured through his battle (walking, spell casting, dying, etc) and connected through an Animation Controller.
