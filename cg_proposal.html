        <h3>Proposal</h3>
        <div class="image-right">
          <img src="img/cg_proposal/method_comp.png" alt="Comparison of different differential solvers">
          <p class="image-caption">A graph comparing the stability of Forward and Backward Euler and Crank-Nicolson Scheme</p>
        </div>
        <p>My proposal for this assignment is to implement two more types of differential solvers: Backwards Euler and the Crank-Nicolson
           Scheme. Backwards Euler is an implicit method, so it is slower than explicit ones like Forwards Euler and Symplectic Euler (sort of),
           but is even more stable than the other two methods. The Crank-Nicolson Scheme is an average of the Fowards and Backwards Euler
           methods, so I would like to see how this compares to the Sympletic Euler method which is also semi-implicit.
        </p>
        <p>I would initially see how these differential solvers work with just the wave equation, and also see how these solvers interact with
           the heat equation. The heat equation is typically modeled using the Backward Euler method, so seeing how it will work with the other
           solvers will also prove interesting. This project will build off of the Scotty3D code from Assignment 4.

        <h3>Report</h3>
        <p>
           Overall, I had underestimated how complex this project would be, and was unable to finish all of the different aspects listed
           in my proposal. I was able to complete most of the Backward Euler integration, using the Eigen C++ libraries to solve the linear
           systems. Unfortunately, the Backward Euler integration is both incredibly slow (due to the Eigen library's slow speed when solving
           linear systems) and is not stable when it runs. I originally had the integrator use the vertex offsets as the function <em>f</em>
           that is solved each frame, but this led to the mesh simply melting back into its original shape rather than behaving like water.
         </p>

           </video>
           <p class="image-caption">An animation of the incorrect Backward Euler implementation, when offsets are calculated independently of velocities.</p>
         </div>
         <p>
           This issue stemmed from the vertices not having any velocity, so I changed the code so that the velocities would be what was solved
           every frame rather than the offsets, which would simply be updated based on the new velocities (offset = offset + timestep * new_velocity).
           While this made the integrator act somewhat more like water, it was incredibly unstable and would break after a few seconds. I'm not
           sure if this was a bug with how I constructed the Laplacian matrix (if i = j then 1, or if i &amp; j are neighbors then cotan weight
           between i &amp; j, else 0) or the fact that I set the initial velocities to v->laplacian() rather than all 0s since otherwise the
           updated velocity vector would always solve to the zero vector.
         </p>
         <p>
            As for the Crank-Nicholson scheme, since it depended on the Backward Euler integrator working correctly, I was not able to finish this
            either by extension. I have code written for it that theoretically would work assuming I had a working implementation of Backward Euler,
            since Crank-Nicholson is simply an average of Forward and Backward Euler. My implementation would simply call the Forward integrator,
            save the offset and velocity for each vertex, then call the Backward integrator, and average the updated offsets and velocities from
            the Backwards integrator with the saved values from calling the Forward integrator.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since I spent so long trying to fix the Backward Euler integrator, I was not able to get to implementing the heat equation simulator at
            all. I had underestimated how long the Backward integrator would take to implement, since I had not had much trouble implementing the
            Forward and Symplectic integrators from Assignment 4, so this assignment has definitely given me a new appreciation for the different algorithms
            solving for solving ODEs and PDEs.
          </p>

          <h3>Controls</h3>
          <p>This project was an extension of Assignment 4, so this is run through Scotty3D. To reach the two new integrators, go into Animate mode (A) then Wave mode (W) and use:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>B:</strong> Backward Euler </li>
            <li><strong>Q:</strong> Crank-Nicholson Scheme</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Technically you can reach the heat equation mode with (H) from Animate mode, but since this was never implemented it will not do anything.</p>
